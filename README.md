ðŸ‘‹ Hey! I'm Tony, an undergraduate at Stanford passionate about all things tech. More specifically, I'm fascinated by GovTech and computational biology.

ðŸŒ² At Stanford, I lead TreeHacks, the largest collegiate hackathon in the US, and have served consulting roles for Microsoft Azure and Fizz.

Feel free to shoot me an email at wangtony@stanford.edu at any time. I love meeting new people, and Iâ€™d love to chat! ðŸš€
