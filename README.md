### 👋 Hey there! 

🌱 I'm Tony, an undergraduate at Stanford passionate about all things tech. Specifically, I'm fascinated by govtech and comp bio.

🌲 I lead TreeHacks, the largest collegiate hackathon in the US, and have consulted for Microsoft Azure and Fizz.

📫 Feel free to shoot me an email at wangtony@stanford.edu at any time. I love meeting new people, and I’d love to chat!
