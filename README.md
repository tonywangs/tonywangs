ðŸ‘‹ Hey! I'm Tony, a freshman at Stanford passionate about AI and entrepreneurship.

ðŸŒ² At college, I serve as Freshman Council President, where I lead representatives across all 24 dorms to connect the Class of 2027. Iâ€™m also an organizer for TreeHacks, the largest collegiate hackathon in the US, and a consultant for Microsoft Azure through the Stanford Marketing Group.

Feel free to shoot me an email at wangtony@stanford.edu. Iâ€™d love to chat! ðŸš€
